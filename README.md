# About

This project is inspired by [Refine CRM(Customer Relationship Management) Example](https://github.com/refinedev/refine/tree/main/examples/app-crm), which is built using [refine](https://refine.dev/) and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

It implement a [GraphQL API](http://graphql.org/) based on [Spring for GraphQL](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql) and provides an example of API for the FrontEnd.

## Features

Some features that are built in:

- The application includes features such as dashboard analytics, a calendar for scheduling appointments, a scrum board for task management, and CRUD operations for managing companies, contacts, and quotes.
- Security: The `/graphql` Http and Websocket endpoint are secured and can only be accessed using a JWT token. More fine grained security is implemented by `@PreAuthorize` annotations on the methods.
- Tests: See `test` folder for typical GraphQL endpoint tests, including tests for security.
- End-to-end browser tests: See `e2e-tests` folder for folder for some [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) based end-to-end tests that test the running application in a real browser.
- Github action workflow:
  - builds and tests the backend.
  - starts the backend including the database with docker-compose to run the end-to-end tests.
  - (see `.github/workflows/build-app.yml`)
